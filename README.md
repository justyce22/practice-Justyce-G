Hi, I'm Justyce Granda and I am from Chula Vista, CA. I am so excited to be apart of SPIS this year and learn some of the basics of coding, as well as meet a ton of new people with a similar major. In my free time recently, I have been rollerskating, longboarding, hanging out with friends, and taking care of my puppy. I absolutely love group/board games so I am super excited for Friday Game Nights!
